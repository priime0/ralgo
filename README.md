# Ralgo

Convenient implementations of various data structures for Racket.

A stable API and backwards-compatability is not guaranteed until this library is
version 1.0+.

## Options

Options represent "Maybe" values -- values that can either be of something or
nothing.

## Queues

We implement standard FIFO queues with a simple algorithm.
